basic programming tasks such as declaring functions and working with errors and exceptions. You also learn about programming paradigms. Finally, you'll learn how to work with Python modules, packages, libraries, and tools.

# data types

- numeric
- sequence
- dictionary
- boolean
- set

## Numeric
- integer
- float
- complex number (real and imaginary numbers)
- 

## Sequence type
- strings (sequence of characters)
- lists (sequence of one or more different or similar data type, essentially an array)
- tuples (similar to lists, contains ordered sequence of one or more types, but they are immutable)

## Dictionary
- stores data in key value object structure where each value can be accessed directly by its key.
- can store any data type
```python
ed = {'a':22, 'b':44}

print(ed['a'])
#22
```
## Boolean
- true or false
## Set
- unordered non-indexed collection of non-repeated values 
```python
example_set = {1,'hello',4.5,"A"}
type(example_set)
```
